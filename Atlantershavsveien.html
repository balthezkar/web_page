		<p><b>“The world's most beautiful car journey”</b></p>
		<p>The Atlantic Road is a very unique stretch of road that leads you all the way into the big ocean. 
		The Atlantic Road was named the building of the century in Norway in 2005, and is also referred to as 
		the world's most beautiful car journey.</p>
		<p>The Atlantic Road connects Averøy with the mainland over islands, islets and reefs using 8 bridges 
		over a distance of 8274 meters. Construction of the road was a major challenge. Road workers experienced 
		as many as 12 hurricanes during the construction of the Atlantic Road before it was opened in 1989. 
		The road is free to run for everyone.</p>
